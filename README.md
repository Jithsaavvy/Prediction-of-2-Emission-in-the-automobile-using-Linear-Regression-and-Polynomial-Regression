# Prediction-of-CO2-Emission-in-the-automobile-using-Linear-Regression-and-Polynomial-Regression

The amount of Co2 emission from the automobiles is predicted using the Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. <br>

This is implemeted in Python by using Scikit-learn[sklearn], Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn <br>

Linear Regression is the process of fiting a linear model with coefficients where the 'residual sum of squares' between the independent x and the dependent y in the dataset is minimized by the linear approximation. <br> <br>
In simple terms, it is the prediction of a dependent variable value (Y) based on a given independent variable (X) <br>

So, when X and Y are plotted in a graph, then linear regression deduces a straight line that best fits the data points. <br>
The equation of straight line is given as, <br>
y=mx+c <br>

I implemented using simple linear regression followed by multiple linear regression <br>

### Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression is used when the data is not actually linear (i.e.) it looks curvy. In fact, many different regressions exist such as quadratic, cubic etc. are available and can be used to fit in the dataset.
In my case, I am using the the two degree polynomial
